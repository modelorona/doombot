# Doombot
or more like an ai with the brains of a toddler...


this was for the GUTS hackathon 2017 morgan stanley challenges. the idea was to create an ai that can play the game in both singleplayer and multiplayer.
as you can see, we did get somewhat there but it wasn't perfect. my team had been to another hackathon literally right before so everyone was burned out.

good fun.
